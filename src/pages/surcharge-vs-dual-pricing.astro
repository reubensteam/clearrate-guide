    <h1>Surcharge vs dual pricing</h1>
    <p>
      Some businesses choose pricing approaches that offset card acceptance costs. Two common approaches are surcharge programs and dual pricing.
      The details depend on card brand rules and applicable state requirements, and setup should be done in a compliant manner.
    </p>

    <h2>Surcharge programs</h2>
    <p>
      A surcharge program applies an additional fee to eligible credit card transactions. Proper disclosure, signage, receipts, and correct configuration
      are typically required. Debit transactions are commonly treated differently under card rules.
    </p>

    <h2>Dual pricing</h2>
    <p>
      Dual pricing presents separate prices depending on payment method (for example, a cash price and a card price). The implementation should be consistent,
      transparent to customers, and aligned with applicable program and disclosure requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Customer experience and price communication</li>
      <li>Correct configuration in terminals/POS (avoid manual “add a fee” behavior)</li>
      <li>Receipt and signage disclosures</li>
      <li>Operational handling for refunds and chargebacks</li>
    </ul>
