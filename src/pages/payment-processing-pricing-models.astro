    <h1>Payment processing pricing models</h1>
    <p>
      Payment processing costs are typically made up of underlying card costs (interchange and network fees) plus a processor/ISO markup.
      Pricing models differ mainly in how transparently those costs are presented and how markups are applied.
    </p>

    <h2>Interchange-plus</h2>
    <p>
      Interchange-plus separates the underlying interchange costs from the processor’s markup. This structure is often used when transparency is a priority,
      especially for merchants with moderate to higher volume.
    </p>

    <h2>Flat-rate pricing</h2>
    <p>
      Flat-rate pricing uses a single percentage (and sometimes a per-transaction fee) regardless of card type. It can be simple to understand,
      but may be less cost-efficient for certain volumes or card mixes.
    </p>

    <h2>Tiered pricing</h2>
    <p>
      Tiered pricing groups transactions into categories (often “qualified/mid/non-qualified”) and applies different rates. It can make it harder to identify
      what drove total costs and to compare apples-to-apples.
    </p>

    <h2>How to compare offers (practical method)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculate <a href="/effective-rate-explained">effective rate</a> from statements</li>
      <li>Identify fixed monthly fees and minimums</li>
      <li>Review per-transaction fees (auth/txn/batch) and gateway costs (if applicable)</li>
      <li>Consider operational needs: funding timeline, support, chargeback flow, hardware</li>
    </ul>
